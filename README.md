# Tensorflow

Introduction to TensorFlow
Welcome to this week's programming assignment! Up until now, you've always used Numpy to build neural networks, but this week you'll explore a deep learning framework that allows you to build neural networks more easily. Machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PaddlePaddle, Torch, Caffe, Keras, and many others can speed up your machine learning development significantly. TensorFlow 2.3 has made significant improvements over its predecessor, some of which you'll encounter and implement here!

By the end of this assignment, you'll be able to do the following in TensorFlow 2.3:

Use tf.Variable to modify the state of a variable
Explain the difference between a variable and a constant
Train a Neural Network on a TensorFlow dataset
Programming frameworks like TensorFlow not only cut down on time spent coding, but can also perform optimizations that speed up the code itself.
